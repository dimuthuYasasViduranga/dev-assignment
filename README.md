## Activity 1
In this activity, I used reusable fetch which I implmented for Activity 3, to demostrate
reusability and also, typically, we fill sates with db calls or api calls rather than 
hard coding data.

## Activity 2
I used 2 paths as mentioned in the question to demostate the answer.

## Activity 3
I created the custom hook that we can import where we want to fetch data.
